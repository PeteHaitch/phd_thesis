- [x] Re-visit summary of WGBS statistical framework chapter
  - __DONE__
- [x] What is the general restriction on $c$ when $p_{h, i} \neq p_{h', i'}$?
  __DONE: All of $\Pi$ must be $\in [0, 1]$ and alll rows of $\Pi$ must sum to 1.__
- [x] Should gene names and cytosine modifications be _italicised_.
   - Yes to gene names, no to cytosine modifications.
   - __DONE__
- [x] "The conditional estimator, works better than the unconditional estimator when the sample size, n, is small [Agresti 2007]." re conditional odds ratio estimators
  - What does "better" mean.
  - __DONE: Cited page in Agresti's intro to CDA textbook (2007).__
- [x] Figure out why E18BUF is missing chrM for within-fragment $NIL \geq 0$ plots.
  - __DONE: I've noted the E18BUF omission in the caption. E18BUF has no chrM data in the 2ac-tuples `MethPat` object because methtuple was never run on that sample-chromosome-2ac combination (nor was chrY). This was due to some sort of omission in the `run_methtuple.sh` script__
- [x] Figure out what's going on with some of the EPISCOPE and Ziller samples that have a high autosome (chr21, I think).
  - __DONE: Yes, it's chr21. But I have no idea what's causing this. Truly weird. I've commented on this in my thesis__.

- [x] Fix formatting of $2 \times 2$ contingency tables to be consistent.
  - __DONE__
- [x] Find submission documents
  - __DONE__
- [x] Tables in datasets chapter run outside margins and are generally a bit of a mess.
  - __DONE: Fixed these tables__
- [x] Check typesetting of C++
  - __DONE: Used a macro__
- [x] Check Sherman `-CG` and `-CH` parameters (e.g., `--CG` or `-CG`)
  - __DONE__
- [x] "dataset" vs. "data set".
  - __DONE: Using dataset__
- [x] Include timings from Lacey et al. in `methsim` chapter.
  - __DONE__
- [x] Check the size of the simulated data as a `MethPat` object.
  - __DONE: updated__
- [x] Plots of beta-correlations separated by strand in a clearer way.
  - __DONE: Added loess fit__

- [ ] Add a representative plot of the within-fragment data for a single sample
- [ ] Increase axis labels in simulation study figures?
- [ ] Add analysis folder to github
  - First upload `.Rmd` analysis scripts.
  - Upload <sample>.CG.<m>.tsv.gz Lister, Seisenberger, Ziller samples (m = 1, 2, 2ac) to figshare. All 1-tuples are under Figshare's 250 MB limit but the same is not true of 2-tuples or 2ac-tuples.
- [ ] Fix MethylationTuples::mantelhaen(). Works if copy-pasted into session but not as part of MethylationTuples package. Then update Software Details in Appendix.
- [ ] Look at some scatterplots of beta-value pairs from simulated data. Include in `methsim` chapter if revealing.
- [ ] Update title of methtuple memory usage plot to refer to 40 samples rather than 49.
- [ ] Check that all Ziller plots are titled "Ziller" and not "Ziller merged"
- [ ] Include `coMET` paper in Chapter 6.
- [ ] Clarify the definition of $\psi_{U}$ for $2 \times 2 \times K$; is it the same as the "collapsed" estimator?
- [ ] Add $\beta$ to the y-axis of the $\beta$-by-PM boxplots.
- [ ] Fix `BiocParallel` citation.
- [ ] Be more specific with what was discovered in the analyses of co-methylation.
- [ ] Move estimation of RRBS CpGs from the appendix to online.
- [ ] Add `makeCGI` to list of software.
- [ ] Multiple $\LaTeX$ typesetting bugs.

# Long term

- MethylomeParam and simulate,MethylomeParam-method are going to need _another_ re-write :(
  - Slots will be something like MethLevelDT, ComethDT (using Mantel-Haenszel estimates), MethLevelCorDT and all will have to be with respect to the levels of the PartitionedMethylome.
- Once switch from "2" to "1" classes/methods made in methsim, fix other TODOs
- Suggest BPPARAM argument for bsapply(). Suggest bpreplicate() added to BiocParallel.
- Could simulate $B$ from Beta distribution rather than Normal, i.e. beta-binomial model! This is what Lacey et al. or `WGBSsuite` do.
- Figure out why an assay in a SummarizedExperiment can be a DataFrame but cannot be inserted using `assay<-`.
- Read Hadley's recommendations on capitalising parameter descriptions and implement them for all packages.
- Finish ASD2 report.
- Update excludes for coveralls packages
