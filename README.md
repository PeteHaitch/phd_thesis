# PhD thesis

Pretty self explanatory. My PhD thesis is written using a Frankenstein combination of Rmarkdown and LaTeX.

This repository is mainly for archival purposes since I will make available a PDF of my thesis as soon as I am permitted. But if you'd like to make the PDF yourself (!?) then this contains all the necessary files. It won't work out of the box, however, because I haven't included all the necessary R packages in the Makefile. I may get to fixing this once I'm back from a much-needed holiday.
