abstract = {Epigenetic modifications are widely accepted as playing a critical role in the regulation of gene expression and thereby contributing to the determination of the phenotype of multicellular organisms. In general, these marks are cleared and re-established each generation, but there have been reports in a number of model organisms that at some loci in the genome this clearing is incomplete. This phenomenon is referred to as transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. Moreover, recent evidence shows that the environment can stably influence the establishment of the epigenome. Together, these findings suggest that an environmental event in one generation could affect the phenotype in subsequent generations, and these somewhat Lamarckian ideas are stimulating interest from a broad spectrum of biologists, from ecologists to health workers.},

abstract = {Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer immense potential for regenerative medicine and studies of disease and development. Somatic cell reprogramming involves epigenomic reconfiguration, conferring iPSCs with characteristics similar to embryonic stem (ES) cells. However, it remains unknown how complete the reestablishment of ES-cell-like DNA methylation patterns is throughout the genome. Here we report the first whole-genome profiles of DNA methylation at single-base resolution in five human iPSC lines, along with methylomes of ES cells, somatic cells, and differentiated iPSCs and ES cells. iPSCs show significant reprogramming variability, including somatic memory and aberrant reprogramming of DNA methylation. iPSCs share megabase-scale differentially methylated regions proximal to centromeres and telomeres that display incomplete reprogramming of non-CG methylation, and differences in CG methylation and histone modifications. Lastly, differentiation of iPSCs into trophoblast cells revealed that errors in reprogramming CG methylation are transmitted at a high frequency, providing an iPSC reprogramming signature that is maintained after differentiation.},

annote = {Good figures of library prep for various methylation sequencing protocols.

"Previous investigations at a limited number of loci have reported significant correlation between the methylation state of CpGs within 1000 bases (Eckhardt et al. 2006). This has prompted the question of whether it was necessary to identify sites of DNA methylation at the single-base level (Down et al. 2008). However, numerous studies have demonstrated the critical importance of knowing the methylation status of individual CpG sites, which can vary even when in very close proximity to apparently invariable methylcytosines (Prendergast and Ziff 1991; Weaver et al. 2004, 2007)."

The difference between BS-seq and MethylC-seq seems to be in the choice of sequencing adaptors. MethylC-seq uses sequencing adaptors where all Cs are methylated, for BS-seq "adaptors that contained methylated adenine bases within DpnI restriction sites close to the site of ligation" are used. "After BS conversion, PCR was performed using primers complementary to the converted adapter sequences, yielding double-stranded DNA that was digested with DpnI to remove only the first adapter set. Sequencing adapters were sub- sequently ligated to the double-stranded BS-converted genomic DNA fragments, and PCR with primers complementary to the adapters was performed to yield a sequencing library"

Reduced representation BS-seq (RRBS-seq): "In this method genomic DNA is first digested by the methylation-insensitive MspI restriction enzyme, which cleaves the phosphodiester bond upstream of the CpG dinuclotide in its CCGG recognition element. Digested DNA is then separated by gel electrophoresis, and one or more specific size fractions are selected. The size-selected DNA is then end repaired, ligated to methylated sequencing adapters (as described above for MethylC-seq), BS converted, and amplified by PCR with primers complementary to the adapter sequences (Fig. 1). The MspI di- gestion and size-selection yields a sequencing library that is enriched for CpG sites"},

abstract = {The DNA of most vertebrates is depleted in CpG dinucleotide: a C followed by a G in the 5' to 3' direction. CpGs are the target for DNA methylation, a chemical modification of cytosine (C) heritable during cell division and the most well-characterized epigenetic mechanism. The remaining CpGs tend to cluster in regions referred to as CpG islands (CGI). Knowing CGI locations is important because they mark functionally relevant epigenetic loci in development and disease. For various mammals, including human, a readily available and widely used list of CGI is available from the UCSC Genome Browser. This list was derived using algorithms that search for regions satisfying a definition of CGI proposed by Gardiner-Garden and Frommer more than 20 years ago. Recent findings, enabled by advances in technology that permit direct measurement of epigenetic endpoints at a whole-genome scale, motivate the need to adapt the current CGI definition. In this paper, we propose a procedure, guided by hidden Markov models, that permits an extensible approach to detecting CGI. The main advantage of our approach over others is that it summarizes the evidence for CGI status as probability scores. This provides flexibility in the definition of a CGI and facilitates the creation of CGI lists for other species. The utility of this approach is demonstrated by generating the first CGI lists for invertebrates, and the fact that we can create CGI lists that substantially increases overlap with recently discovered epigenetic marks. A CGI list and the probability scores, as a function of genome location, for each species are available at http://www.rafalab.org.},

annote = {"Nearly one-quarter of all methylation identified in embryonic stem cells was in a non-CG context, suggesting that embryonic stem cells may use different methylation mechanisms to affect gene regulation. Methylation in non-CG contexts showed enrichment in gene bodies and depletion in protein binding sites and enhancers. Non-CG methylation disappeared upon induced differentiation of the embryonic stem cells, and was restored in induced pluripotent stem cells."

Non-CpG methylation is prevalent in embyronic stem cells, but this phenomenon is lost upon cell differentiation.

Need to learn the different between MethylC-Seq and BS-Seq (see Lister 2009).

H1 = human embryonic stem cells
IMR90 = fetal lung fibroblasts (female)

Mapped against hg18

Shitloads of data; 14x average coverage of each strand. Over 1 billion reads (pooled) for each of H1 and IMR90

Non-CpG methylation is generally mCHG or MCHH

99.98% of methylation in IMR90 is CpG. 75% in H1.

Two biological replicates of each cell type.

H1: 77% of mCG sites were 80-100% methylated, 85% of mCHG and mCHH were 10-40% methylated.
IMR90: 56% of mCG were 80-100% methylated

H1: a positive correlation between non-CpG methylation density and gene expression. No correlation between CpG methylation density and gene expression.

Figures 3g,h are interesting.

"99% of mCG sites from the human cell lines were methylated on both strands, surprisingly mCHG was highly asymmetrical, with 98% of mCHG sites being methylated on only one strand."

A periodicity of 8-10 bp is observed in the preference of distances between neighbouring methylation sites (corresponds to a single turn of the DNA helix).

IMR90: "the widespread prevalence of partially methylated domains (PMDs) on the autosomes was unexpected". Was expected on X since IMR90 is female (X inactivation).

Supp. Figure 12b shows the % of CpGs in each read that are methylated (similar to what I want to examine in Kasper's data).

Fisher's exact test is used to test for DMR regions between H1 and IMR90.

"The exclusivity of non-CG methylation in stem cells, probably maintained by continual de novo methyltransferase activity and not observed in differentiated cells, suggests that it may
have a key role in the origin and maintenance of this pluripotent state."

Methods: Bowtie against hg18, methylation state based on base calls against reference cytosine positions

Supplementary Material

It appears to be standard practice to include a spike-in control genome for estimating bisulfite conversion efficiency.

Sequencing on Illumina GAII

Pre-processing of reads: Trim bases with qualities {\&}lt;3, remove adapter (sub)sequence contamination from 3' end of reads (there was a number of reads with such contamination), do C-{\&}gt;T conversion in reads.

Pre-processing of reference genome: C-{\&}gt;T in hg18 and G-{\&}gt;A in hg18, i.e. two reference genomes. The Lambda reference genome (the spike-in control) was included as an extra chromosome in the reference sequence to allow reads coming from it to align to it. "As all Cs in the reads were replaced with Ts, the methylation status of a particular genomic sequence has no bearing on its ability to map to the reference" (aka 'bias-free' alignment).

"Sequences originating from the Watson strand of the genome aligned to the cytosine-free reference sequence, whereas sequences originating from the Crick strand (complement) of the genome aligned to the guanine-free reference sequence after reverse complementation"

Reads from biological replicates were pooled; analysed as pools and as individual samples.

PCR duplicate removal was performed, only unique alignments used.

A strange mismatch filtering - "if a read contained more than 3 mismatches compared to the reference sequence, it was trimmed to the base preceding the 4th mismatch" - why must the 5' end of the read be correctly mapped in such a case?

Reads containing more than 3 non-CpG Cs were discarded (due to likely poor bisulfite conversion of read).

The method to identify methylated cytosines is quite different to in Hansen et al. Can't quite make sense of it.
"In this way, we established the minimum threshold number of Cs sequenced at each reference C position at which the position could be called as methylated" - this seems to be  a binary classification of methylated or unmethylated for every C in the reference genome.

They do some correction for the fact that the sequenced samples have their own genotypes (i.e. they differ from the reference sequence). But this is only to assess whether a mC is from a CpG or not. 

Identification of differentially methylated cytosines
Positions with "similar coverage" are defined as those with a coverage ratio of 0.8-1.2 between H1 and IRP90 - this seems a little strange and arbitrary. Why not use a Poisson model of read counts and then take the ratio of Poisson RVs - perhaps this is what they did and 0.8-1.2 is an 'acceptance' region of the hypothesis: ratio = 1. But of course this has problems since Pr(denominator = 0) {\&}gt; 0. Or could assume Poisson RVs and test the equality of means.
Fisher's test
Seems to be a test of the 2x2 table (H1, IMR90) x ({\#} of methylated Cs, {\#} of unmethylated Cs). One table per C(pG) in the reference.
"Only mCG determined using the binomial distribution analysis in at least one cell type and those mCG covered by at least 3 reads in at least one cell type were considered for testing." - seems to be done to reduce the multiple testing burden.

Identification of DRMs - pretty ad hoc and conservative approach. Relies on results of Fisher's test in the "identification of methylated Cs" section. Uses overlapping sliding windows to call DMRs.

Identification of partially methylated domains (PMDs) - again, quite ad hoc. Uses non-overlapping sliding windows.},

Here we present the first genome-wide, single-base-resolution maps of methylated cytosines in a mammalian genome, from both human embryonic stem cells and fetal fibroblasts, along with comparative analysis of messenger RNA and small RNA components of the transcriptome, several histone modifications, and sites of DNA-protein interaction for several key regulatory factors. Widespread differences were identified in the composition and patterning of cytosine methylation between the two genomes. Nearly one-quarter of all methylation identified in embryonic stem cells was in a non-CG context, suggesting that embryonic stem cells may use different methylation mechanisms to affect gene regulation. Methylation in non-CG contexts showed enrichment in gene bodies and depletion in protein binding sites and enhancers. Non-CG methylation disappeared upon induced differentiation of the embryonic stem cells, and was restored in induced pluripotent stem cells. We identified hundreds of differentially methylated regions proximal to genes involved in pluripotency and differentiation, and widespread reduced methylation levels in fibroblasts associated with lower transcriptional activity. These reference epigenomes provide a foundation for future studies exploring this key epigenetic modification in human disease and development.},

abstract = {DNA methylation is implicated in mammalian brain development and plasticity underlying learning and memory. We report the genome-wide composition, patterning, cell specificity, and dynamics of DNA methylation at single-base resolution in human and mouse frontal cortex throughout their lifespan. Widespread methylome reconfiguration occurs during fetal to young adult development, coincident with synaptogenesis. During this period, highly conserved non-CG methylation (mCH) accumulates in neurons, but not glia, to become the dominant form of methylation in the human neuronal genome. Moreover, we found an mCH signature that identifies genes escaping X-chromosome inactivation. Finally, whole-genome single-base resolution 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC) maps revealed that hmC marks fetal brain cell genomes at putative regulatory regions that are CG-demethylated and activated in the adult brain, and that CG demethylation at these hmC-poised loci depends on Tet2 activity.},

abstract = {Although vertebrate DNA is generally depleted in the dinucleotide CpG, it has recently been shown that some vertebrate genes contain CpG islands, regions of DNA with a high G+C content and a high frequency of CpG dinucleotides relative to the bulk genome. In this study, a large number of sequences of vertebrate genes were screened for the presence of CpG islands. Each CpG island was then analysed in terms of length, nucleotide composition, frequency of CpG dinucleotides, and location relative to the transcription unit of the associated gene. CpG islands were associated with the 5' ends of all housekeeping genes and many tissue-specific genes, and with the 3' ends of some tissue-specific genes. A few genes contained both 5' and 3' CpG islands, separated by several thousand base-pairs of CpG-depleted DNA. The 5' CpG islands extended through 5'-flanking DNA, exons and introns, whereas most of the 3' CpG islands appeared to be associated with exons. CpG islands were generally found in the same position relative to the transcription unit of equivalent genes in different species, with some notable exceptions. The locations of G/C boxes, composed of the sequence GGGCGG or its reverse complement CCGCCC, were investigated relative to the location of CpG islands. G/C boxes were found to be rare in CpG-depleted DNA and plentiful in CpG islands, where they occurred in 3' CpG islands, as well as in 5' CpG islands associated with tissue-specific and housekeeping genes. G/C boxes were located both upstream and downstream from the transcription start site of genes with 5' CpG islands. Thus, G/C boxes appeared to be a feature of CpG islands in general, rather than a feature of the promoter region of housekeeping genes. Two theories for the maintenance of a high frequency of CpG dinucleotides in CpG islands were tested: that CpG islands in methylated genomes are maintained, despite a tendency for 5mCpG to mutate by deamination to TpG+CpA, by the structural stability of a high G+C content alone, and that CpG islands associated with exons result from some selective importance of the arginine codon CGX. Neither of these theories could account for the distribution of CpG dinucleotides in the sequences analysed. Possible functions of CpG islands in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression were discussed, and were related to theories for the maintenance of CpG islands as "methylation-free zones" in germline DNA.},
