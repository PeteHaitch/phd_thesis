# Chapter Overview
The basic biology necessary for understanding this thesis, such as genomics and epigenetics, are explained. DNA methylation is introduced, some of its biological roles are described and the types of questions asked by experiments studying DNA methylation are discussed. Assays for studying DNA methylation are described, with a particular focus on the whole-genome bisulfite-sequencing assay known as _methylC-seq_. The typical bioinformatics strategies for analysing bisulfite-sequencing data are described in broad terms. Finally, the remainder of the thesis is outlined.


# DNA, DNA methylation and epigenetics
## DNA
_DNA_, an much-needed abbreviation of deoxyribonucleic acid, is the molecule that encodes the genetic instructions for all known living organisms. __INSERT DNA DEFINITION FROM TEXTBOOK__ The four nucleotides are adenine (_A_), cytosine (_C_), guanine (_G_) and thymine (_T_). These nucleotides form complementary base pairings, _A_ with _T_ and _C_ with _G_, in the DNA double helix (__INSERT FIGURE OF DNA BASE PAIRING__).



## DNA methylation
DNA methylation is a chemical modification of DNA that can impart information on top of the DNA's genetic code. This notion of DNA methylation "encoding information on top of DNA" fits in with its definition as an _epigenetic_ mark, _epi_ being derived from the Greek word for "upon, near to or in addition"__INSERT DICTIONARY REFERENCE__. The broader role of epigenetics is discussed below in the section on [Epigenetics].

DNA methylation is heritable during mitotic cell division, which means that it is faithfully copied across to the daughter cell during cell division[^mitotic]

[^mitotic]: In practice this copying is not as faithful as, say, the copying of DNA from the parent to the daughter strand. Furthermore, the faithfulness of this copying will be different in different conditions, such as in a healthy, well-differentiated liver cell compared to a cancerous liver cell. Nevertheless, the copying of DNA methylation is faithful enough for most biologists to consider it as a mitotically heritable mark most of the time.

So pervasive is DNA methylation in mammalian genomes that it has been dubbed the "fifth base" [@Lister:2009bo], alongside the four bases of DNA: adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine.  In fact, what is referred to as DNA methylation is typically restricted to methylation of the cytosine nucleotide. Cytosine methylation is by far the most common (__only?__) form of DNA methylation, however I will continue to use the terms DNA methylation and cytosine methylation interchangeably as is standard in the literature.

The C5 carbon position is the typical site of methylation on a cytosine nucleotides. (__INSERT DIAGRAM__).  Cytosine methylation occurs in (__all__?) mammalian genomes, such as human and mouse, but not in the genomes of other lower organisms __such as?__. It's existance in other organisms, such as the common fruit fly (_Drosophila Melanogaster_), is an area of contention although recent studies suggest it is present albeit at very small quantities and only in very limited contexts [@Takayama:2014jp]. 

__PARAGRAPH ON DNAm ESSENTIALNESS IN MAMMALS__



What is clear from all this is that DNA methylation, while not essential for life in all organisms, is essential in higher order species such as mammals.
