### [Copyright](http://gradresearch.unimelb.edu.au/handbooks/phd/research.html#copyright)

> Before you contemplate publication of your thesis either online or in print, it is important that you understand both your rights and obligations under copyright. Some publishers require that you sign an author or publishing agreement. Before signing any agreement, you should make sure that you fully understand the terms and your rights under the agreement. __If your thesis includes copyright material created by other people, you must ensure that you have the right to publish this material. While the fair dealing provisions of the Copyright Act allow you to reproduce a limited amount of third party copyright works in your thesis for the purpose of study and research, you cannot rely upon these provisions when you publish the work to the world. If you intend to publish your work, you will generally need to seek permission from the copyright owner as there are only limited provisions in the Copyright Act that allow material to be published without permission.__ Visit the University's Copyright website for more information.

- [ ] What does this mean for the use of figures published in articles, textbooks or on websites?

### [Ethics approval](http://gradresearch.unimelb.edu.au/handbooks/phd/research.html#ethics)

> __All projects requiring the use of human participants, animals, genetically modified organisms or hazardous biological agents are subject to review and approval by the appropriate University committee prior to commencement of the work. Approval will not be granted retrospectively.__ Further information about research ethics and the requirements of the Human Research Ethics Committee, Animal Welfare Committee or Gene Technology and Biosafety Committee is available in departments or from the Office of Research Ethics and Integrity.

- [ ] Clarify what, if any, ethics statement I need in my thesis.
  - I am not directly performing any experiments as part of my PhD. However, I am using data from experiments that would require such ethics approval. In particular, the collaborations with Sue Clark (human samples) and Emma Whitelaw (mouse samples).

### [Editing of theses](http://gradresearch.unimelb.edu.au/handbooks/phd/thesis.html#editing)

> The use of third party editorial assistance, either paid or voluntary, must be acknowledged in the Preface and is limited to the guidelines adopted by the University.

- [ ] Acknowledge all proofreaders in Preface.

- [ ] Find a `wordcount` function for LaTeX or markdown files.

### [Preparation of a thesis that contains published work](http://gradresearch.unimelb.edu.au/handbooks/phd/thesis.html#published)

> Thesis chapters may be comprised of work that is written specifically for the thesis, reprints or other reproductions of published works or an adaptation of published work..

- I don't expect this be an issue for me as I am not re-using any published work.

> Publications, such as reprints of journal articles, published creative writing and catalogues and documentation of public performances or exhibited work, may also be included in an appropriate form in the appendix, __including for example as DVD, CD or URLs, if not included as a chapter__.
- [ ] Include all URLs of software in appendix.

### [Format of the thesis](http://gradresearch.unimelb.edu.au/handbooks/phd/thesis.html#format)

> A thesis should include the following formatting:
* International Standard Paper Size A4 (297 x 210mm)
* 1.5 spacing and presented in a clear and legible font and would normally be expected to be double-sided
* Left and right margins of no less than 30mm and page numbers that appear inside the margins
* Pages that are numbered consecutively and clearly
* Folding diagrams or charts arranged so as to open to the top and right.

- [ ] Check the spacing and margins of my LaTeX pdf.

#### Order of contents

> A thesis follows the following order:
* Title page
* Abstract
* Declaration
* Preface (if applicable)
* Acknowledgments
* Table of contents
* List of tables, figures and illustrations (if list items are fewer than 10 in number, this is not necessary)
* Main text
* Bibliography or List of References
* Appendices.

- [ ] Check order of my thesis.

#### Title page

> A thesis must be preceded by a title page. The title page of the thesis should show the:
* Title of the thesis
* Full name of the author (as it appears in the Student Portal)
* Degree for which submitted (see below)
* Month and year
* Name of the department or faculty in which the research was carried out.

> Candidates who have pursued a course of study by research alone, including combined Masters/PhD degrees, shall state on the title page: "Submitted in total fulfilment of the requirements of the degree of Doctor of Philosophy".

- [ ] Check title page fits criteria.

#### Abstract

> The title page must be followed by an abstract of 300–500 words in English (in the case of creative arts the Abstract must include a description of the form and presentation of the creative work).

#### Declaration

> The following declaration page, signed by the candidate:

> This is to certify that:
* the thesis comprises only my original work towards the PhD except where indicated in the Preface,
* due acknowledgement has been made in the text to all other material used,
* the thesis is fewer than 100 000 words in length, exclusive of tables, maps, bibliographies and appendices OR the thesis is [number of words] as approved by the Research Higher Degrees Committee.

#### Preface

> If applicable, a Preface page includes a statement of:
* Work carried out in collaboration indicating the nature and proportion of the contribution of others and in general terms the portions of the work which the candidate claims as original
* Work submitted for other qualifications
* Work carried out prior to PhD candidature enrolment
* any third party editorial assistance, either paid or voluntary (as limited to the Editing of Research Theses by Professional Editors guidelines) and/or
* Where a substantially unchanged multi-author paper is included in the thesis a statement prepared by the candidate explaining the contributions of all involved. A signed copy by all authors must be included with the submission form.

#### Thesis preparation and binding

> Theses should normally be bound using thermal binding.

> Thermally bound theses must be used with covers strong enough to resist damage by bending or knocking. Twin-ring, spring-back and spiral binders are not acceptable, as theses bound in these ways frequently do not survive travel through the post. Thermal binding should not exceed 300 pages (absolute maximum thickness of 35mm per copy).

> If there are photographs or charts which need to be included in the thesis, facilities are available for colour laser printing and photocopying in the Graduate Student Association (GSA)and a scanner is available in the Graduate Presentation and Publishing Centre. The GSA also provides a thermal binding and photocopying service (refer to [The Graduate Centre](http://gradresearch.unimelb.edu.au/handbooks/phd/intro.html#centre)).
