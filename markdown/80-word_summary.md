By analysing more than fifty whole-genome bisulfite-sequencing (WGBS) datasets I develop a statistical framework for analysing and modelling DNA methylation data. In particular, I focus on understanding the complex dependence structure of DNA methylation data and how this structure can be incorporated into statistical analyses. Using this knowledge, I develop software to simulate WGBS data, which can be used to develop and benchmark analysis methods. I also analyse WGBS experiments to identify epialleles and differentially methylated regions.
