"Previous investigations at a limited number of loci have reported significant correlation between the methylation state of CpGs within 1000 bases (Eckhardt et al. 2006). This has prompted the question of whether it was necessary to identify sites of DNA methylation at the single-base level (Down et al. 2008). However, numerous studies have demonstrated the critical importance of knowing the methylation status of individual CpG sites, which can vary even when in very close proximity to apparently invariable methylcytosines (Prendergast and Ziff 1991; Weaver et al. 2004, 2007)."

The difference between BS-seq and MethylC-seq seems to be in the choice of sequencing adaptors. MethylC-seq uses sequencing adaptors where all Cs are methylated, for BS-seq "adaptors that contained methylated adenine bases within DpnI restriction sites close to the site of ligation" are used. "After BS conversion, PCR was performed using primers complementary to the converted adapter sequences, yielding double-stranded DNA that was digested with DpnI to remove only the first adapter set. Sequencing adapters were sub- sequently ligated to the double-stranded BS-converted genomic DNA fragments, and PCR with primers complementary to the adapters was performed to yield a sequencing library"

Reduced representation BS-seq (RRBS-seq): "In this method genomic DNA is first digested by the methylation-insensitive MspI restriction enzyme, which cleaves the phosphodiester bond upstream of the CpG dinuclotide in its CCGG recognition element. Digested DNA is then separated by gel electrophoresis, and one or more specific size fractions are selected. The size-selected DNA is then end repaired, ligated to methylated sequencing adapters (as described above for MethylC-seq), BS converted, and amplified by PCR with primers complementary to the adapter sequences (Fig. 1). The MspI di- gestion and size-selection yields a sequencing library that is enriched for CpG sites"},

abstract = {Complete sequences of myriad eukaryotic genomes, including several human genomes, are now available, and recent dramatic developments in DNA sequencing technology are opening the floodgates to vast volumes of sequence data. Yet, despite knowing for several decades that a significant proportion of cytosines in the genomes of plants and animals are present in the form of methylcytosine, until very recently the precise locations of these modified bases have never been accurately mapped throughout a eukaryotic genome. Advanced "next-generation" DNA sequencing technologies are now enabling the global mapping of this epigenetic modification at single-base resolution, providing new insights into the regulation and dynamics of DNA methylation in genomes.},
