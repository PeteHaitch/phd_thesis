annote = {Developed a statistical algorithm for detecting DNA methylation changes in regions smaller than blocks ({\&}lt; 5kb).

Biological replicates essential/critical

BSmooth
"Permits accurate and precise estimates of methylation values with 4x coverage." Averages across neighbouring CpGs and across biological samples to improve estimates over naive single-CpG and single-sample estimates.

Let M = {\#} methylated reads and U = {\#} of unmethylated reads (N = M + U = coverage at a particular CpG. Assume M is distributed Binomial(N, p).
p_naive = M/N
Instead, use local likelihood estimation (Ref. C Loader "Local regression and likelihood") to give greater weight to CpGs with larger N. Assumed that p(L), where L = location, was a smooth function of L, meaning proximal CpGs had similar methylation levels.

Developed two methods: 
(1) Using low frequency smoothing for blocks
(2) High frequency smoothing for small DMRs

BSmooth was validated against high-coverage capture bisulfite sequencing.

Use t-stats based on smoothed methylation values while accounting for biological variability to find blocks and small DMRs. Standard errors estimated from normal samples (cancers show "too much" variability), i.e. did not assume cancers were biological replicates. Also computed "sample-specific" blocks, i.e. one cancer vs. 3 normals.

Estimate CNV stats by circular binary segmentation (CBS).

Age (of patient, not sample) is known to affect methylation profiles.

Tested whether methylation has a causal role in increased variation observed in cancer, i.e. greater variability at 50% methylation due to the binomial nature of methylation.
Tested with an overdispersed binomial model
Found not to be the case

For microarrays, tested increased variability at CpGs using F-test.
This test is extremely sensitive to outliers (Wikipedia)
Alternatives, includes Levene's, Bartlett's test and Brown-Forsythe test

Fairly substantial filter of read-bases based on position in read prior to calling methylation "evidence".
All evidence that passed the filter was added to a CpG summary table (includes nucleotide, mappability, GC, etc. information) 

Bisulfite conversion rate estimated from lambda-phage control (spike in) genome

Need to check non-CpG cytosine methylation by examining data.

"Evidence" bases with base-quality {\&}lt; 10 were filtered out prior to methylation smoothing.

BSmooth
Uses tricube kernel
Large N ={\&}gt; greater weight in local-likelihood
Large windows for low frequency differences (blocks)
Small window for high frequency differences (small DMRs)
Smoothed data evaluated on the same grid of data points ("covered CpGs") consisting of those CpGs where at least two normal samples have coverage {\&}gt;= 2x

Small DMRs used window of 70CpGs or 1kb, whichever was larger
Blocks used max(500 CpGs, 2kb)

Standard errors
High frequency - 0- 0.11 (mean 0.04)
Low frequency - 0.01-0.04 (mean 0.02)

Let p_i(L)^(C/N) be smoothed methylation estimate for sample i at location L, C/A = cancer/normal.
d(L) = 1/n SUM( p_i^C(L) - p_i^N(L)), where SUM is over i = 1,...,S

Estimate s.e.(d(L)) using normal samples ONLY.
s.e.(d(L)) = sigma(L) * sqrt(2/3), sigma(L) = s.d.(p_i^N(L))

s.e.(d(L)) were also smoothed
Used a running mean with window size of 101 observations
Set threshold for s.d. of its 75th percentile before computing the smoothed result (to avoid inflated t-stats due to artificially low variants)

Used t-test for finding differences in methylation (these take into account biological variability)
t(L) = d(L)/se(d(L))

For the high frequency analysis, the t-stat was further corrected for low frequency changes, e.g. to find local features within global features
Fairly ad hoc method

Further filtering of 'called' small DMRs
Heuristic filter

DMRs classified based on methyl-profiles within DMR and two flanking regions (800bp) in both cancer and normal samples
Classification done with algorithm

Strand bias may be a problem in BS-seq data
MUST BE CHECKED

Validatation pyrosequencing evidence isn't the most convincing

CNVs calculated from complete, unfiltered data
No obvious relationship between CNV status and methylation call.

Their alignment assumes no or low non-CpG methylation (see Supp. Material)

annote = {"Nearly one-quarter of all methylation identified in embryonic stem cells was in a non-CG context, suggesting that embryonic stem cells may use different methylation mechanisms to affect gene regulation. Methylation in non-CG contexts showed enrichment in gene bodies and depletion in protein binding sites and enhancers. Non-CG methylation disappeared upon induced differentiation of the embryonic stem cells, and was restored in induced pluripotent stem cells."

Non-CpG methylation is prevalent in embyronic stem cells, but this phenomenon is lost upon cell differentiation.

Need to learn the different between MethylC-Seq and BS-Seq (see Lister 2009).

H1 = human embryonic stem cells
IMR90 = fetal lung fibroblasts (female)

Mapped against hg18

Shitloads of data; 14x average coverage of each strand. Over 1 billion reads (pooled) for each of H1 and IMR90

Non-CpG methylation is generally mCHG or MCHH

99.98% of methylation in IMR90 is CpG. 75% in H1.

Two biological replicates of each cell type.

H1: 77% of mCG sites were 80-100% methylated, 85% of mCHG and mCHH were 10-40% methylated.
IMR90: 56% of mCG were 80-100% methylated

H1: a positive correlation between non-CpG methylation density and gene expression. No correlation between CpG methylation density and gene expression.

Figures 3g,h are interesting.

"99% of mCG sites from the human cell lines were methylated on both strands, surprisingly mCHG was highly asymmetrical, with 98% of mCHG sites being methylated on only one strand."

A periodicity of 8-10 bp is observed in the preference of distances between neighbouring methylation sites (corresponds to a single turn of the DNA helix).

IMR90: "the widespread prevalence of partially methylated domains (PMDs) on the autosomes was unexpected". Was expected on X since IMR90 is female (X inactivation).

Supp. Figure 12b shows the % of CpGs in each read that are methylated (similar to what I want to examine in Kasper's data).

Fisher's exact test is used to test for DMR regions between H1 and IMR90.

"The exclusivity of non-CG methylation in stem cells, probably maintained by continual de novo methyltransferase activity and not observed in differentiated cells, suggests that it may
have a key role in the origin and maintenance of this pluripotent state."

Methods: Bowtie against hg18, methylation state based on base calls against reference cytosine positions

Supplementary Material

It appears to be standard practice to include a spike-in control genome for estimating bisulfite conversion efficiency.

Sequencing on Illumina GAII

Pre-processing of reads: Trim bases with qualities {\&}lt;3, remove adapter (sub)sequence contamination from 3' end of reads (there was a number of reads with such contamination), do C-{\&}gt;T conversion in reads.

Pre-processing of reference genome: C-{\&}gt;T in hg18 and G-{\&}gt;A in hg18, i.e. two reference genomes. The Lambda reference genome (the spike-in control) was included as an extra chromosome in the reference sequence to allow reads coming from it to align to it. "As all Cs in the reads were replaced with Ts, the methylation status of a particular genomic sequence has no bearing on its ability to map to the reference" (aka 'bias-free' alignment).

"Sequences originating from the Watson strand of the genome aligned to the cytosine-free reference sequence, whereas sequences originating from the Crick strand (complement) of the genome aligned to the guanine-free reference sequence after reverse complementation"

Reads from biological replicates were pooled; analysed as pools and as individual samples.

PCR duplicate removal was performed, only unique alignments used.

A strange mismatch filtering - "if a read contained more than 3 mismatches compared to the reference sequence, it was trimmed to the base preceding the 4th mismatch" - why must the 5' end of the read be correctly mapped in such a case?

Reads containing more than 3 non-CpG Cs were discarded (due to likely poor bisulfite conversion of read).

The method to identify methylated cytosines is quite different to in Hansen et al. Can't quite make sense of it.
"In this way, we established the minimum threshold number of Cs sequenced at each reference C position at which the position could be called as methylated" - this seems to be  a binary classification of methylated or unmethylated for every C in the reference genome.

They do some correction for the fact that the sequenced samples have their own genotypes (i.e. they differ from the reference sequence). But this is only to assess whether a mC is from a CpG or not. 

Identification of differentially methylated cytosines
Positions with "similar coverage" are defined as those with a coverage ratio of 0.8-1.2 between H1 and...}
