annote = {Su Yeon showed in her presenation of this paper that AG and TC errors are far more likely out of the 12 possible error probs. I should  compare with GATK output for some of my samples.

Reiterates the key point (that I first saw made by Heng Li) that often we don't need to infer genotypes to do the inference we are interested in. Indeed, we are often better off NOT inferring genotypes as these only introduce noise.

"Conclusions: Overall, our results suggest that association mapping and estimation of allele frequencies should not be based on genotype calling in low to medium coverage data. Furthermore, if genotype calling methods are used, it is usually better not to filter genotypes based on the call confidence score."

Propose a method that does not assume the site is biallelic.

"Overall, the new ML method out-performs genotype calling methods."

"...when depth is not very high, the genotyping calling methods are likely to include a lot of false SNPs that are sequencing errors"

Similar to earlier paper by Su Yeon, an improvement of this approach is allowing for uncertainty in determining which allele is the minor allele.

For depths {\&}gt; 10x the genotype calling methods do pretty well.

"As currently implemented our method does not tackle the problem of SNP calling itself. In principle, our approach could be extended to use a LRT to call SNPs...A feature of our approach to estimating frequencies is that it is not necessary to first call SNPs prior to estimating frequencies, which may be beneficial in certain circumstances."

Their approach assumes that the loci analysed are in HWE.

Definition due to Gardiner-Garden and Frommer.
This definition is not suitable across species

Methylation is heritable
CpG loss by
(i) CpG methylation
(ii) Damination
(iii) Failure of the repair system to identify a U-G pair.

Hao Wu (2010, also features Rafa as an author)  is read in the 5' to 3' direction.

Methylation and gene regulation
Methylation can impede the binding of transcriptional proteins to the gene, thus blocking transcription
Methylated DNA may be bound by proteins that start a series of chemical events that result in the formation of compact DNA that renders it inactive.

The DNA of most vertebrates is depleted in CpG dinucleotides.

Methylation and cancer
Altererd DNA methylation in cancer

CGI shores - regions with 2kb of CGIs, but not inside a CGI

By an evoluationary argument, a CGI is not defined by the CpG density per se but the CpG density conditional on the GC content of the region.}

First few paragraphs full of useful stuff

"De novo DNA methylation is carried out by the DNA methyltransferase enzymes DNmT3A and DNmT3b complexed with DNmT3l8,10, a closely related homo- logue that lacks methyltransferase activity11. DNmT3l recruits the methyltransferases to DNA by binding to histone H3 in the nucleosome, but contact between
DNmT3l and the nucleosome is inhibited by all forms of methylation on H3K4 (ref. 8). As a result, de novo methylation in the embryo takes place at the majority of CpG sites in the genome, but may be prevented at CpG islands because of the presence of H3K4me. This model is consistent with the finding of a strong anti-correlation between DNA methylation and the presence of H3K4me in several cell types."

Chromatin = Histone (protein) + DNA

Histones can be methylated too; specifically the N-terminals can be methylated, acetylated,phosphorelated or ubiquitylation.

DNAme and histone methylation are dependent ("crosstalk")

Nucleosome - Two each of H2A, H2B, H3 or H4 make up the octomeric nucleosome, around which DNA winds

DNAme distribution is bimodal - almost all non CGI CpGs are methylated whereas almost all CGI CpGs are unmethylated.}

The proposed inference is not pointwise but topological.

"Our general proposed algorithm consists of the following steps:
1. Kernel smoothing, to increase SNR 
2. Candidate peaks: find local maxima of the smoothed sequence. 
3. P-values, computed at each local maximum under the complete null
hypothesis of no signal anywhere. 
4. Multiple testing: use a multiple testing procedure to find a global threshold and declare significant all peaks exceeding that threshold."

Because tests are performed at local maxima, the number of tests is itself a RV. This is in contrast to the standard multiple-testing literature that assumes the number of tests is fixed.

Requires a "strong signal" assumption, i.e. each signal peak is represented by only one observed local maximum within the true domain with Prob -{\&}gt; 1.

P-values are calculated from the "Palm" distribution, which is stochastically greater than the Gaussian distribution.

Train the method on known spikes and known "noise".}

Watson = antisense strand or template for RNA transcription. + strand.

Crick = sense strand or partner strand that is complementary to template for RNA transcription. - strand.

List 3 main problems with aligning BS-seq reads and discuss ways to overcome these.

If you use 3 reference genomes (normal + 2 BS-converted genomes [forward strand with C{\&}gt;T and reverse strand with G{\&}gt;A conversions]) then the number of bisulfite C/T alignments you can detect per read is limited by the mismatch parameters of your aligner.

BSmap - assumes all C positions in the reference genome are already known (what of SNPs?). Mask Ts in the bisulfite reads as Cs (i.e. reverse bisulfite conversion) only at C positions in the original reference while keeping all other Ts in the bisulfite reads unchanged. Map masked read to reference.

BSmap uses a HASH table seeding algorithm, only searches reads when the seed perfectly matches.

BSmap based on SOAP - each read split into 4 parts, 2 of which are used for the seed. The HASH table includes all possible seeds in the ref sequence with their bisulfite variants as keys and the corresponding coordinates as values. The bisulfite variants of a specific seed are generated by enumerating all possible C={\&}gt;T combinations.

All Cs in reference are transformed, not just Cs in CpGs?

"In BSMAP, each bisulfite read and its reverse complementary sequence are aligned with both the Watson and the Crick strands of the reference sequence. This procedure is equivalent to mapping BS reads to four bisulfite strands (BSW, BSWR, BSC, and BSCR) "

"BSMAP supports gapped/pair-end alignment and iterative trimming of low-quality base pairs, as well as parallel computing in multi-thread execution"

"Longer reads will contain more bisulfite C/T alignments and are therefore more likely to exceed the maximum mismatch threshold and become un-mappable. On the other hand, longer reads will have more true mismatches, such as SNPs, and thus will tolerate fewer bisulfite C/T alignments as mismatches. Therefore, with increased read length, we would expect a rapid drop in mapping sensitivity.

annote = {Developed a statistical algorithm for detecting DNA methylation changes in regions smaller than blocks ({\&}lt; 5kb).

Biological replicates essential/critical

BSmooth
"Permits accurate and precise estimates of methylation values with 4x coverage." Averages across neighbouring CpGs and across biological samples to improve estimates over naive single-CpG and single-sample estimates.

Let M = {\#} methylated reads and U = {\#} of unmethylated reads (N = M + U = coverage at a particular CpG. Assume M is distributed Binomial(N, p).
p_naive = M/N
Instead, use local likelihood estimation (Ref. C Loader "Local regression and likelihood") to give greater weight to CpGs with larger N. Assumed that p(L), where L = location, was a smooth function of L, meaning proximal CpGs had similar methylation levels.

Developed two methods: 
(1) Using low frequency smoothing for blocks
(2) High frequency smoothing for small DMRs

BSmooth was validated against high-coverage capture bisulfite sequencing.

Use t-stats based on smoothed methylation values while accounting for biological variability to find blocks and small DMRs. Standard errors estimated from normal samples (cancers show "too much" variability), i.e. did not assume cancers were biological replicates. Also computed "sample-specific" blocks, i.e. one cancer vs. 3 normals.

Estimate CNV stats by circular binary segmentation (CBS).

Age (of patient, not sample) is known to affect methylation profiles.

Tested whether methylation has a causal role in increased variation observed in cancer, i.e. greater variability at 50% methylation due to the binomial nature of methylation.
Tested with an overdispersed binomial model
Found not to be the case

For microarrays, tested increased variability at CpGs using F-test.
This test is extremely sensitive to outliers (Wikipedia)
Alternatives, includes Levene's, Bartlett's test and Brown-Forsythe test

Fairly substantial filter of read-bases based on position in read prior to calling methylation "evidence".
All evidence that passed the filter was added to a CpG summary table (includes nucleotide, mappability, GC, etc. information) 

Bisulfite conversion rate estimated from lambda-phage control (spike in) genome

Need to check non-CpG cytosine methylation by examining data.

"Evidence" bases with base-quality {\&}lt; 10 were filtered out prior to methylation smoothing.

BSmooth
Uses tricube kernel
Large N ={\&}gt; greater weight in local-likelihood
Large windows for low frequency differences (blocks)
Small window for high frequency differences (small DMRs)
Smoothed data evaluated on the same grid of data points ("covered CpGs") consisting of those CpGs where at least two normal samples have coverage {\&}gt;= 2x

Small DMRs used window of 70CpGs or 1kb, whichever was larger
Blocks used max(500 CpGs, 2kb)

Standard errors
High frequency - 0- 0.11 (mean 0.04)
Low frequency - 0.01-0.04 (mean 0.02)

Let p_i(L)^(C/N) be smoothed methylation estimate for sample i at location L, C/A = cancer/normal.
d(L) = 1/n SUM( p_i^C(L) - p_i^N(L)), where SUM is over i = 1,...,S

Estimate s.e.(d(L)) using normal samples ONLY.
s.e.(d(L)) = sigma(L) * sqrt(2/3), sigma(L) = s.d.(p_i^N(L))

s.e.(d(L)) were also smoothed
Used a running mean with window size of 101 observations
Set threshold for s.d. of its 75th percentile before computing the smoothed result (to avoid inflated t-stats due to artificially low variants)

Used t-test for finding differences in methylation (these take into account biological variability)
t(L) = d(L)/se(d(L))

For the high frequency analysis, the t-stat was further corrected for low frequency changes, e.g. to find local features within global features
Fairly ad hoc method

Further filtering of 'called' small DMRs
Heuristic filter

DMRs classified based on methyl-profiles within DMR and two flanking regions (800bp) in both cancer and normal samples
Classification done with algorithm

Strand bias may be a problem in BS-seq data
MUST BE CHECKED

Validatation pyrosequencing evidence isn't the most convincing

CNVs calculated from complete, unfiltered data
No obvious relationship between CNV status and methylation call.

Their alignment assumes no or low non-CpG methylation (see Supp. Material)

annote = {SureShrink - a procedure to recover a function of unknown smoothness from noisy observations.

If unknown function contains jumps so does the reconstruction.
If unknown function contains a smooth piece so does the reconstruction.
"The advantages of the method are particularly evident when the underlying function has jump discontinuities on a smooth function."

N observations from y_i = f(t_i) + z_i, i = 1,...,N, t_i = (i-1)/N, z_i is Normal(0, sigma^2)
Want to estimate f = {f(t_i)} i = 1,...N with small mean square error, i.e. fhat with small risk R(fhat, f) = 1/N E( ||fhat - f ||_2^2 ) = E(Ave_i (fhat(t_i) = f(t_i))^2

SureShring
(1) Discrete wavelet transform of noisy data
(2) Thresholding of noisy wavelet coefficients
(3) Stein's unbiased estimate for risk for threshold choice

Examples in paper are from various inhomogeneous phenomenon
`Bumps' example may be most relevant to methylation (though the bumps are sharp and short). Perhaps `blocks' is closer...

SureShrink requires and permits no user intervention; it is automatically smoothness adaptive.

"Crucial detail" - the wavelet coefficients are not computed by matrix multiplication, but by a sequence of special finite-length filtering steps.

The function is reconstructed from building blocks of zero-mean localised square waves if M = 0.
If M {\&}gt; 0, the building blocks are smoother and wiggly, hence `wavelets'. 

The simplest SureShrink approach has problems where the signal is zero at most coordinates.}

annote = {Wavelet analysis versus Fourier analysis: "The key point is that the basic Fourier transform highlights the spectrum of a function, signal, image etc., but this frequency decomposition is global rather than localised, whereas the wavelet transform offers a localised frequency decomposition. It provides information not only on what frequency components are present in a signal but also when, or where, they are occuring. Wavelets therefore have significant advantages over basic Fourier analysis when the object under study is non-stationary or inhomogeneous.

Can perform nonparametric regression with wavelets. Modifications are required on the standard DWT and IDWT algorithms if the data are non-equispaced or sample sizes are not a power of 2 or data contaminated with correlated noise (see references).

The key is choosing M (the length of the truncated wavelet series). Too small a value of M = oversmoothed; too large = undersmoothed; M=J-1 reproduces the data. But this approach struggles with functions that have singularities and smooth sections; oversmoothed in some places, undersmoothed in others.

Thus use non-linear wavelet estimators (Donoho and Johnstone). Choose "significant" wavelet coefficients and set others to zero - results in sparse representation of g.

Donoho and Johnstone's estimator outperforms any linear estimator, including the truncated and shrunk linear wavelet estimators (described above). Thresholding is in some sense analogous to multiple hypothesis testing (testing how many wavelet coefficients are different from 0).

annote = {Supplementary material contains a very useful table of published whole-genome BS-seq data.

"Mechanisms exist to maintain methylation at CpGs during DNA replication, meaning CpG methylation usually occurs on both strands" (with reference).

"non-CpG methylation must be re-established de-novo after each cell division"

"since cytosine methylation is not symmetrical, the two strands of DNA in the reference genome must be considered separately"

"A single site can have a different methylation state in different cells"

Recommend "Finding the 5th base" by Lister et al. for a schematic of BS-libraries.

If you consider both C and T as potential matches to a reference C you have the highest possible mapping efficiency (high sensitivity), however the methylated reads will be aligned with greater efficiency since they carry more information than their unmethylated counterparts, leading this type of alignment to overestimate methylation levels.

Alternatively, convert any residual Cs in the BS-read to Ts before the alignment and all Cs to Ts in the reference, then use a normal alignment tool. This approach comes at the cost of a slightly reduced mapping efficiency.

In silico C to T conversion should not be used on colour space datasets because this will bugger up the colour space encoding unless the read is error-free. "A single measurement error in the read would lead to incorrect conversions throughout the rest of the reads."
WHAT ABOUT MERMAN????

For SOLiD data "current tools...use methylation-aware alignments (SOCS-B) (computationally intensive) or align reads to an in silico converted version of the reference genome, where bs-induced mismatches are treated as normal mismatches." Biased - see paragraph on B-SOLANA.

Bismark, BS-Seeker and B-SOLANA all use Bowtie.

Bismark specific(?) - "If a base is mis-aligned or mis-called, then on average it will display a methylation rate of 50% since both C and T are equally likely to be misplaced against a genomic C."

Weighting of base calls "would only be of benefit for mis-called bases rather than mis-aligned reads."

In their simple simulation, as the (base-level) error rate increased so did the apparent methylation level.

To avoid methylation mis-calls or mis-mappings strict alignment parameters should be used (NB this will obviously reduce mapping efficiency).

A better way of decreasing methylation call errors is trimming poor quality data prior to alignment, e.g. using cutadapter, FASTX, etc.

Should always check for adapter contamination (e.g. using kmer analysis in FASTQC) prior to alignment.

The results of their simulation study, which involves base-call quality degradation and adapter contamination, suggest that increasing the read length of bisulfite sequences does not necessarily translate into a linear increase in methylation information gained from an experiment. Similarly, paired-end reads do not automatically yield twice the amount of methylation data compared to single-end experiments since they result in a considerable amount of redundant methylation calls where both reads overlap."

Their beef with PE BS-seq is due to problems with library preparation - e.g. short inserts and sequencing adapters. They also analyse BS-seq in a "pileup" format rather than a "along-the-read" format that I am proposing.

Bisulfite conversion efficiencies seem to remain a problem. A spike-in dataset seems to be the current recommendation.

MpsI is the most common RRBS restriction endonuclease. MpsI comes from the Moraxella species (http://www.thelabrat.com/restriction/MspI.shtml).

There are some fiddly bits with end-repair and adapter ligation. Basically the last two(?) bases at the 3' end of reads should be excluded when the read length is longer that the fragment to be sequenced - this is particularly problematic for RRBS as fragments are usually size selected to be between 40 and 220bp long. "In such cases, reads should be screened for the occurrence of cytosine residues or a second MspI site just before reading
6into a potential adapter contamination towards the 3' end, and trimmed back until the modified bases have been removed. 

"In addition, paired-end or non-directional RRBS libraries may also contain reads originating from filled-in MspI sites at the beginning of the reads which consequently need to be excluded from downstream analysis."

Reinforce the point re "when SNVs meet CpGs".

Urge aggressive filtering and trimming of reads even if that removes some real data since the contamination is much worse than the data loss.

"SE reads 50-70bp in length seem to offer a reasonable compromise providing good mappability without running into problems associated with longer read lengths."

"For base space it is critical...}

RRBS reduces the complexity of the genome and enriches for CpG islands using restrictions enzymes and size selection.

RRBS alignment is more complicated than for WGBS - e.g. align against fragments from an in silica MspI digested genome

Contains a great explanation of RRBS.

Duplicates are guaranteed in RRBS.

Short insert sizes, and thus adapter contamination, will frequently occur in RRBS. 

At Illumina they only do SE for RRBS.

"The WGBS sample prep protocol produces relatively short insert sizes, so a pre-alignment trimming step is important for many data sets"

For WGBS they also advocate aggressive trimming.

Illumina only de-dup for PE WGBS.}

Figure 1a and 1b - the 5mC aren't at CpGs. Why?

After bisulfite conversion the sense and antisense strands (+/-) are no longer complimentary.

Mapping algorithm is going to be very important.

They map to 3 references: the standard, a fully converted +strand reference, and a fully converted -strand reference. Allow up to 5 mismatches in the 50bp reads.

Due to the library construction, matches to the reverse complement of the bisulfite converted reference are invalid.

{\textasciitilde}60% reads mapped uniquely.

Mapping to the non-converted reference genome results in {\&}lt;1% of reads aligning.

Claim colour-space is superior to base-space for 'reduced alphabet' genomes such as bisulfite converted genomes.

{\textasciitilde}300x fold coverage

E. coli has two methylases - dam (methylates adenines) and dcm (methylates the 2nd C residue in the CCWGG motif, where W = A or T).

"A site was called partially methylated, if (1) T (= non-methylated) was called at least 25% of the time or if (2) T was called at least 14% and the same genomic position was partially methylated after criteria 1 in the corresponding library (bis-sol or bis-gel)."

"the human genome is more difficult to query for methylated CpG motifs, due to clustered CpG-islands. These non-separable islands need to be mapped to unconverted reference sequences in order to ensure correct matching."

Both BS-gel and BS-solution performed very well and similarly. BS-gel perhaps suited to smaller amounts of starting material as it can't cope well with large amounts of starting material.

Figure 3 is a very handy table of colour-space colours in a normal and bisulfite-converted genome.

Reference 11 contains definition of valid and invalid mismatches in colour-space.

"Data Analysis
Two bisulfite converted references (+ and 2 strands) were created by replacing in silico all Cs to Ts in the sense (+) and antisense (2) strands of the DH10B genome (GenBank accession CP000948), respectively. Sequencing reads were aligned to the + and 2 bisulfite converted references and the DH10B genome (normal reference) using the SOLiDTM System Analysis Pipeline Tool (http:// solidsoftwaretools.com/gf/project/corona/), allowing a maximum

Matches to the reverse complement of the + and 2 bisulfite converted references were discarded, since only one strand was amplified during library construction and thus matches to the reverse complement are mismatches.

RRBS alignment is more complicated than for WGBS - e.g. align against fragments from an in silica MspI digested genome

Contains a great explanation of RRBS.

Duplicates are guaranteed in RRBS.

Short insert sizes, and thus adapter contamination, will frequently occur in RRBS. 

At Illumina they only do SE for RRBS.

"The WGBS sample prep protocol produces relatively short insert sizes, so a pre-alignment trimming step is important for many data sets"

For WGBS they also advocate aggressive trimming.

Illumina only de-dup for PE WGBS.}

To compare methylation at CpGs, methylation estimates are binned into three categories - low, mid, high methylation. For non-CpGs, methylation estimates are binned into - no methylation, low methylation, high methylation. Cutoffs defined by %'s. Some sort of chi-square type test of independence of methylation between 2 cell lines.

"In mammals, DNA methylation is established by the de novo methyltransferase DNMT3 [32-34] during early embryogenesis. The maintenance methyltransferase DNMT1 methylates hemi-methylated CG sites during DNA replication, leading to symmetrically methylated CG sites [15,35]"

Test for allele-specific expression by combining RNA-seq and BS-seq data.

To test for differential methylation - bin into 1kb bins, take ratios of methylation levels and use standard Z score {\&}gt; 2. FDRs calculated using permutation.






"Extracting conserved differentially methylated regions
To detect genomic regions where one cell line is more methylated than the other, we surveyed all 1-kb windows and calculated the ratio of the methylation levels in the windows between the more methylated cell line and the less methylated one. If the standard Z score of this ratio exceeds two, then this region is considered differentially methylated. The conserved differentially methylated regions are the overlapping differentially methylated regions from all three pairwise comparisons. In our analysis we found 0.11% of the genome is conserved differentially methylated (see Additional file 7 for a list of the conserved differentially methylated regions).

To estimate the FDR of the fraction of the conserved differentially methylated regions, we first randomized the order of the average methylation levels calculated from the genome of each cell line. We then calculated the fraction of the conserved differentially methylated regions in this randomized permutation. The average fraction of the conserved differentially methylated regions from 300 simulations is 0.0006% (standard deviation = 4.7E-7), which gives an estimate of FDR of 0.54%."}

Test is also appliacable to situations of testing for trend in a single curve

Generalises to when the observation space differs between samples, i.e. {x_1i} and {x_2i} differ

Test is a scaled version of T_n = 1/n SUM(fhat(x_i) - ghat(x_i))^2, where SUM is from 1=i,...,n
fhat and ghat are kernal estimates of f and g

Use larger bandwidths for detecting differences between f and g. Use smaller bandwidths for estimating f or g.

The test statistic S_n (scaled T_n) has a proper limiting distribution and S_n -{\&}gt; infinity under the alternate hypothesis at rate n (under technicality)
Therefore asymptotic alpha-level test of the null, based on the asymptotic distribution of S_n, has limiting power equal to 1.

Methylation in non-CG contexts showed enrichment in gene bodies and depletion in protein binding sites and enhancers. Non-CG methylation disappeared upon induced differentiation of the embryonic stem cells, and was restored in induced pluripotent stem cells."

Non-CpG methylation is prevalent in embyronic stem cells, but this phenomenon is lost upon cell differentiation.

Need to learn the different between MethylC-Seq and BS-Seq (see Lister 2009).

H1 = human embryonic stem cells
IMR90 = fetal lung fibroblasts (female)

Mapped against hg18

Shitloads of data; 14x average coverage of each strand. Over 1 billion reads (pooled) for each of H1 and IMR90

Non-CpG methylation is generally mCHG or MCHH

99.98% of methylation in IMR90 is CpG. 75% in H1.

Two biological replicates of each cell type.

H1: 77% of mCG sites were 80-100% methylated, 85% of mCHG and mCHH were 10-40% methylated.
IMR90: 56% of mCG were 80-100% methylated

H1: a positive correlation between non-CpG methylation density and gene expression. No correlation between CpG methylation density and gene expression.

Figures 3g,h are interesting.

"99% of mCG sites from the human cell lines were methylated on both strands, surprisingly mCHG was highly asymmetrical, with 98% of mCHG sites being methylated on only one strand."

A periodicity of 8-10 bp is observed in the preference of distances between neighbouring methylation sites (corresponds to a single turn of the DNA helix).

IMR90: "the widespread prevalence of partially methylated domains (PMDs) on the autosomes was unexpected". Was expected on X since IMR90 is female (X inactivation).

Supp. Figure 12b shows the % of CpGs in each read that are methylated (similar to what I want to examine in Kasper's data).

Fisher's exact test is used to test for DMR regions between H1 and IMR90.

"The exclusivity of non-CG methylation in stem cells, probably maintained by continual de novo methyltransferase activity and not observed in differentiated cells, suggests that it may
have a key role in the origin and maintenance of this pluripotent state."

Methods: Bowtie against hg18, methylation state based on base calls against reference cytosine positions

Supplementary Material

It appears to be standard practice to include a spike-in control genome for estimating bisulfite conversion efficiency.

Sequencing on Illumina GAII

Pre-processing of reads: Trim bases with qualities {\&}lt;3, remove adapter (sub)sequence contamination from 3' end of reads (there was a number of reads with such contamination), do C-{\&}gt;T conversion in reads.

Pre-processing of reference genome: C-{\&}gt;T in hg18 and G-{\&}gt;A in hg18, i.e. two reference genomes. The Lambda reference genome (the spike-in control) was included as an extra chromosome in the reference sequence to allow reads coming from it to align to it. "As all Cs in the reads were replaced with Ts, the methylation status of a particular genomic sequence has no bearing on its ability to map to the reference" (aka 'bias-free' alignment).

"Sequences originating from the Watson strand of the genome aligned to the cytosine-free reference sequence, whereas sequences originating from the Crick strand (complement) of the genome aligned to the guanine-free reference sequence after reverse complementation"

Reads from biological replicates were pooled; analysed as pools and as individual samples.

PCR duplicate removal was performed, only unique alignments used.

A strange mismatch filtering - "if a read contained more than 3 mismatches compared to the reference sequence, it was trimmed to the base preceding the 4th mismatch" - why must the 5' end of the read be correctly mapped in such a case?

Reads containing more than 3 non-CpG Cs were discarded (due to likely poor bisulfite conversion of read).

The method to identify methylated cytosines is quite different to in Hansen et al. Can't quite make sense of it.
"In this way, we established the minimum threshold number of Cs sequenced at each reference C position at which the position could be called as methylated" - this seems to be  a binary classification of methylated or unmethylated for every C in the reference genome.

They do some correction for the fact that the sequenced samples have their own genotypes (i.e. they differ from the reference sequence). But this is only to assess whether a mC is from a CpG or not. 

Identification of differentially methylated cytosines
Positions with "similar coverage" are defined as those with a coverage ratio of 0.8-1.2 between H1 and...}

Cast CNV problems in two different classes: (1) Normal samples where few small "non-null" regions - amenable to hypothesis-testing framework and FDR methods; (2) Tumour samples where a large number of long "non-null" regions - more amenable to an estimation framework, e.g. model selection or smoothing.

Uses a moving average to smooth CNV estimates.

Develop an FDR procedure and a permutation procedure for testing the significance of the number of non-null positions.

Features a neat trick to get the posterior mean or posterior standard deviation in an empirical Bayes setting.
