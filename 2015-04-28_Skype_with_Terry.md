# Discussing co-methylation chapter

- 2-tuples vs. pairs. Use pairs instead of 2-tuples (e.g. p153)
- Spatial correlation is not like traditional autocorrelation.
- Plots of beta-correlations separated by strand in a clearer way.
  - Use loess to summarise trend
- "Figures 7.11, 7.12, 7.13 and 7.14 are plots of Spearman correlations of β-values for pairs of CpGs stratified by whether the pair is inside or outside of a CpG island" (p163) __Figure references are wrong; increment by four__
- In general, plots of beta-correlations are noisy. Just show trend?
- p175 "The odds ratio is not perfece, however. For one, the possible values of ψ are highly". The odds ratio is indepndent of the margins (Terry's favourite point about the odds ratio; emphasise).
- top of p176: latex error
- "The conditional estimator, works better than the unconditional estimator when the sample size, n, is small [Agresti 2007]."
  - What does "better" mean.
- p177: s/convert/converge/
- p178: "we analysed a sim. study" -> "we carried out a simulation study"
- When $K$ is known, use the actual value. Improve legends.
- Increase axis labels in simulation figures
- Include figure number when talking about Simulation 3 or 4, etc.
- chrM results are worth commenting on
- chrX with NIL \geq 0 look similar to CGI in that they increase separation.
- Add SE and PE information to plots of within-fragment co-methylation
- Add a representative plot of the within-fragment data for a single sample
- Could remove spearman vs. pearson figures by showing proper "versus" plot and then skipping ahead.
- p197 Something weird has happened.
- Comment on other genomic features that might be interesting to stratify by.
- Comment on how you might reduce heterogeneity by subsampling.
