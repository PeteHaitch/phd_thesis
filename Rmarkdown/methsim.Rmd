# Chapter overview


# Introduction

Simulation studies play a vital role in the development, validation and benchmarking of methods in applied statistics. Simulation is necessary when there is a lack of real datasets with well-known outcomes that we would otherwise use to assess a method's performance. While simulated data can never fully capture the richness of "real" data, we can learn a lot about a method by studying how it performs when applied to simulated data.

While we may sometimes be able to design an experiment with known outcomes via the use of controls, both positive and negative, this is not always possible in genomics. One reason for this is the cost of performing a well-designed control experiment. Why spend your time and money on an experiment where you "know the answer" when you could be spending that same time and money on investigating something new? Another reason is that in genomics we are often working with cutting-edge technology that is so new that we lack the technological and biological knowledge to even design such a control experiment.

The key advantage of using simulated data over real data is that we know the truth _a priori_. Moreover, we can manipulate the truth via parameters in the simulation model and can examine how a method performs under a variety of scenarios. And this manipulation is cheap, a mere matter of changing parameters and re-running a piece of software, which means that we can investigate a broad range of plausible scenarios.

Simulation studies can provide many insights into the performance of a method. At the most basic level, if a method fails to work or performs poorly when applied to simulated data, then it is very unlikely to work well when applied to real data. We can also identify which scenarios are "easy", ones where most methods are able to identify the truth, and scenarios under which certain methods perform better than others.

Simulation studies can also tell us about the plausibility of hypothesised stochastic or mechanistic models of a phenomenon. By simulating data from the proposed model and comparing it to the real data we can identify shortcomings in the model that we can later refine.

In the field of genomics, almost all papers proposing a new method will include a simulation study and perhaps a comparison to existing methods, if these exist. There are a few key criteria when designing a simulation method:

1. Realism: The simulated data must be "similar" to the real data. While this is obvious, it is also often hard to pin down or agree upon what constitutes "similar enough".
2. Cost: It should be fast and cheap to simulate data. The most common use of simulation models in applied statistics is to repeatedly generate datasets under a range of parameter settings. This requires that each simulation is fast and computationally cheap, otherwise it will be prohibitive to analyse the full space of scenarios. An exception to this rule may occur when the simulation model is used to test a proposed mechanistic or stochastic model of a phenomenon, such as in studies of molecular dynamics. Even then, however, the cost of a simulation should be less than the cost of performing the equivalent experiments, otherwise the simulation is generally not worth the effort.
3. Usability: There __must__ be a software implementation. Simulation models exist to be simulated from; a simulation model without an implementation is next to useless. The implementation should give the user easy access to the key  parameters and have sensible default settings. The output of the software should be in a standard format or readily convertible to a simple, manipulable format.

The above discussion refers to the general use of simulation models, particularly in applied statistics. I now turn my attention to the need for simulation models in the study of DNA methylation. Whole-genome bisulfite-sequencing remains an expensive assay, costing a few thousand dollars per sample (human) at the time of writing. Understandably, studies using WGBS have been from well-funded research groups focusing on "sexy" biology rather than on efforts to generate extensively-validated control datasets.

The statistical methodology to analyse such experiments lags somewhat behind the ability to generate the data, as is common in genomics. Nonetheless, more statistical methods are being published seeking to address common research questions such as identifying differential methylation. However, because of the lack of "gold-standard" datasets, it is not clear which of these perform well for common experimental designs and research questions. Many of these published methods feature a simulation study in the accompanying paper, but, as we will shortly see, these simulations are woefully inadequate, unrealistic and vary between papers. In order to perform a proper benchmarking of these methods we require a realistic simulation model, something that I have attempted to address with my software, `methsim`, which I describe in this chapter.

# Background + literature review

Simulated bisulfite-sequencing data may be used in the comparison of strategies for the alignment and processing of bisulfite-converted reads, or in the comparison of downstream analysis methods. Simulation methods for bisulfite-sequencing data may choose to simulate the individual sequencing reads, unaligned or aligned, or some summary measure of methylation, such as $\beta$-values. The former is required for the comparison of different alignment strategies whereas the latter is typically used by developers of downstream analysis methods, such as differential methylation callers, since this is often all that is required to run these methods. Moreover, simulated reads must be aligned and processed before they can be used in comparisons of downstream analysis methods, which is often not of direct relevance in comparisons of these tools.

A simulation may be model-based or based on sampling of real data, roughly corresponding to parametric and non-parametric simulation models, respectively.  It is often simpler to simulate from a model-based simulation, particularly if the model is a well-studied parametric distribution. However, this simplicity often comes at the cost of increased assumptions, whose validity may be questionable. Of course, the parameters in any model-based simulation should be estimated from real data, although this may not use formal estimation procedures such as maximum likelihood.

In contrast, simulations based on sampling of real data may reduce the number of assumptions required. However, care must be taken in selecting the units to be sampled so that the sampling process is efficient and so that the sampled data don't grossly distort within- and between-sample dependencies.

## Methods for simulating bisulfite-sequencing reads

All of the available methods for simulating bisulfite-sequencing reads are designed for the comparison of alignment strategies and are model-based. These are not suitable for comparisons of downstream analysis methods.

`Sherman` ([http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/sherman/](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/sherman/)) is software to simulate bisulfite-sequencing reads, including various 'contaminants', such as SNPs, basecall errors and sequence artefacts as `FASTQ` files. The simulated reads are designed for comparing the performance of different alignment strategies. It has many parameters, of which the ones relevant to our discussion of simulating realistic DNA methylation data are `-CG` and `-CH`, the bisulfite conversion rates for CG and CH methylation loci, respectively. These are set by the user with values between $0$ and $100$. Reads are simulated by sampling from the user-specified reference genome. When a read contains a CG (resp. CH) locus, it is randomly assigned as being converted (unmethylated) with probability `-CG` / 100 (resp. `-CH` / 100).  

While suitable for comparing alignment strategies, `Sherman` produces data that is not suitable for use in comparing downstream analysis methods. All CG (resp. CH) loci have an average $\beta$-value of `-CG` (resp. `-CG`) regardless of the genomic context, which we know to be inconsistent with real data. Furthermore, the methylation state of each methylation locus is independent, which is clearly inconsistent with the strong co-methylation observed in real data.

`FastqToBS` ([http://users.dimi.uniud.it/~nicola.prezza/projects.html](http://users.dimi.uniud.it/~nicola.prezza/projects.html)) uses the same strategy as `Sherman`.

`DNemulator` ([http://www.cbrc.jp/dnemulator/README.html](http://www.cbrc.jp/dnemulator/README.html)) uses a slightly more sophisticated simulation strategy to simulate `FASTQ` files for use in comparing alignment strategies for bisulfite-sequencing data. `DNemulator` does this with three separate routines, `fasta-methly-sim`, `fasta-polymorph` and `fasta-bisulf-sim`:

1. `fasta-methyl-sim` converts cytosines in the reference genome (`FASTA` file) to a character indicating the methylation level of that locus: `C` represents $0\%$ methylated, `c` represents $10\%$ methylated, `d` represents $20\%$ methylated, `v` represents $50\%$ methylated and `t` represents $100\%$ methylated. Each of these conversions has a different probability in the CG and CH contexts.
2. `fasta-polymorph` simulates a polymorphic, diploid genome based on the modified reference sequence created by `fasta-methyl-sim`.
3. `fasta-bisulf-sim` simulates reads by sampling from the simulated genome created by `fasta-polymorph`. Read are simulated with bisulfite-conversion error and sequencing error.

The reads simulated by `DNemulator` will result in $\beta$-values that have more context-dependence than those resulting from reads generated by `Sherman`, `FastqToBS` or `BSsim`. However, methylation events are still generated independently of one another, which means there is no co-methylation in the simulated data. Therefore, reads simulated by `DNemulator`, while suitable for comparing alignment strategies, are not suitable for comparing downstream analysis methods.

`BSsim` ([http://122.228.158.106/BSSim/](http://122.228.158.106/BSSim/) and used in \cite{Xie:2014ez}), uses a similar strategy to `DNemulator`.

## Methods for simulating aggregate methylation levels

Most papers that propose a new method for downstream analysis of bisulfite-sequencing data include a simulation section. Generally, the simulation method is not a major feature of the paper but is there to support claims about the performance of the proposed method. Consequently, the simulation model is often only briefly described and a software implementation is rarely made available. In fact, of the methods reviewed in this section, only that of \citet{Lacey:2013iy} has a software implementation available.

The most widely studied downstream analysis problem is that of identifying differential methylation. Differential methylation is identified by comparing summary measures of methylation, such as $\beta$-values, between two or more groups. It is therefore generally not necessary to simulate individual reads but is sufficient to simulate these summary measures directly. As the `methsim` software is focused on simulating data for comparing methods for calling differential methylation, I review methods designed for a similar purpose.

A common framework for simulating data for a $k$-group experiment is the following hierarchical model:

1. Simulate the unobserved group-specific true methylation levels, $B_{i, j_{k}}$, where $j_{k}$ indicates that sample $j$ comes from group $k$.
  - For non-differentially methylated loci all $k$ groups have identical $B_{i, j_{k}}$.
  - Differentially methylated loci are simulated by setting loci with $B_{i, j_{k}} \neq B_{i, j_{k'}}$
2. Simulate the observed sample-specific sequencing depths, $u_{i, j} + m_{i, j}$.
3. Simulate the observed sample-specific methylation levels, $\beta_{i, j_{k}}$ from some model incorporating both $B_{i, j_{k}}$ and $u_{i, j} + m_{i, j}$.

A popular choice of parametric model is the Beta-Binomial distribution \cite[e.g.,]{Feng:2014iq, Lacey:2013iy, Xu:2013eg, Chen:2014jb, Dolzhenko:2014bo}. Under this model the true methylation level, $B_{i, j}$, is assumed to follow a $Beta(\mu_{i, j}, \phi_{i, j})$ distribution, and the $\beta$-values are simulated from a Binomial distribution, $\beta_{i, j} = Binomial(m_{i, j} + u_{i, j}, B_{i, j})$.

### Simulating sequence depth

The sequencing depths, $m_{i, j} + u_{i, j}$, are typically sampled from real data \cite[e.g.]{Feng:2014iq, Chen:2014jb, Dolzhenko:2014bo}, although a rounded Normal distribution \cite{Xu:2013eg} and a rounded mixture of Gamma distributions have also been used \cite{Lacey:2013iy}.

The most sophisticated approach to simulation of sequencing depth in bisulfite-sequencing experiments is the RRBS simulation of \cite{Lacey:2013iy}. In addition to using a mixture of distributions to capture both the low-coverage and high-coverage modes observed in RRBS sequencing coverage, the authors model the correlation of sequencing depth across samples for a given region. They do this by using a Normal copula to make the set of sequencing depths a jointly dependent set of random variables. While this is undoubtably sophisticated, the effect of correlated versus uncorrelated sequencing depths in a simulation model is not explored in the paper and so the benefits are unclear. Moreover, it is simpler to include such correlations by a sensible sampling of real data. Specifically, this can be achieved by sampling sequencing depth across samples for a given region rather than sampling across the full set of sequencing depths.

### Simulating $B_{i, j}$

Under the Beta-Binomial model, $\mu_{i, j}$ is the mean and $\phi_{i, j}$ the dispersion of the Beta distribution[^beta_parameterisation]. Both the means, $\mu_{i, j}$, and the dispersions, $\phi_{i, j}$, are group-specific and are allowed to vary across methylation loci ($i$). The dispersion parameter models the within-group variability of the $B_{i, j}$, i.e., the _biological variability_ of DNA methylation.

[^beta_parameterisation]: Note that this is different to the standard parameterisation of the Beta distribution, which is described by two shape parameters, $\alpha$ and $\beta$. The relationship between the two parameterisations is $\mu = \frac{\alpha}{\alpha + \beta}$ and $\phi = \frac{1}{\alpha + \beta + 1}$ \cite{Feng:2014iq}.

As noted by \cite{Feng:2014iq}, the Beta distribution is a very flexible distribution with support on $[0, 1]$ and has "long been a natural choice to model binomial proportions", particularly as a conjugate prior, as it is used in the empirical Bayes model of \cite{Feng:2014iq}. The Beta-Binomial model can also be viewed from a non-Bayesian perspective as a compound distribution or overdispersed Binomail distributions

Other distributions may be used instead of the Beta distribution. For example, \cite{Xie:2014ez} consider a Normal distribution and a mixture of Normal distributions and \cite{Xu:2013eg} consider the truncated Normal and a mixture of truncated Normal distributions.

An alternative to specifying a parametric distribution for the $B_{i, j}$ would be to sample these from real data, i.e., sample the observed $\beta_{i, j}$. However, without further perturbation, such an approach would have insufficient within-group variability since all samples in that group have the same "true" methylation level.

While the simulation of differentially methylated loci is straightforward - simply vary the mean of the distribution of $B_{i, j_{i}}$ across the $k$ groups - the simulation of differentially methylated regions is more complex. In principal we would simply simulate a differentially methylated region by simulating runs of differentially methylated loci. However, it must be noted that this requires careful choice of parameters. Such parameters include the length of DMRs, the minimal number of loci they must contain, the maximal intra-pair distances of loci within a DMR and how many of the loci in the DMR must themselves be differentially methylated, e.g., should __FIGURE__ be considered one DMR or two DMRs? (__TODO: Figure with 4 DMCs, then 1 non-DMC and then 5 DMCs). These decisions ultimately have to be made by the user of the simulation software based on the types of events they are interested in. For example, DMRs in cancer can be very long whereas others may be interested in identifying very short DMRs overlapping transcription factor binding sites.

### Simulating co-methylation

A key feature ignored by all the above methods, with the honourable exception of \cite{Lacey:2013iy}, is co-methylation. The methylation states of neighbouring loci are highly dependent and, consequently, the $B_{i, j}$ of nearby loci are highly dependent. To be clear, almost all of the published simulation studies of bisulfite-sequencing data have failed to model a very important feature of DNA methylation data, co-methylation.

As demonstrated in Chapter \ref{chap:co-methylation}, the physical process of co-methylation is at the level of individual DNA fragments, not at the level of aggregate methylation levels. The observed correlations of $\beta$-values are driven by this within-fragment co-methylation. However, a simulation model of DNA methylation data need not induce correlations at the level of individual DNA fragments. Indeed, if the model does not simulate the individual fragments then it cannot simulate within-fragment co-methylation but it may be able to capture correlations of methylation levels by inducing dependence in the $B_{i, j}$. This could be induced under the Beta-Binomial model by forcing the $\mu_{i, j}$ to be spatially dependence. This idea takes its inspiration from \citet{Jaffe:2012gx} who simulate spatially correlated DNA methylation microarray data by imposing an autocorrelation structure [AR(1)] on the simulated $\beta$-values.

\cite{Lacey:2013iy} take a different approach, but one that still results in correlated $B_{i, j}$. To begin, they compute $\beta$-values from chromosome 11 for a single normal myotube cell line that was sequenced with RRBS. They then fit a Gaussian variogram to these $\beta$-values, which shows "a strong correlation for sites in close proximity, decaying to near independence at distances beyong 3000 bp". To simulate spatially correlated $B_{i, j}$ they use an iterative process:

1. Simulate $B_{i, j}$ from a Beta distribution with parameters estimated from the chromosome 11 MTCTL2 data. These are estimated under an assumption of independence.
2. Induce correlation amongst the $B_{i, j}$ (across $i$) by a transformation of the $B_{i, j}$.

The second step uses a method published by \cite{Zaykin:2002ko}. The transformed values, $B^{*}$, are created by the transformation $B^{*}_{i, j} = 1 - \Phi{C \Phi - 1(1 - B)}$, where $C$ is a factor of the correlation matrix $\Sigma = C C^{'}$, which is estimated from the fitted Gaussian variogram, and where $\Phi(\dot)$ denotes the standard normal distribution function.

\cite{Lacey:2013iy} supply R scripts to implement their simulation method ([http://rrbs-sim.r-forge.r-project.org/](http://rrbs-sim.r-forge.r-project.org/)). __TODO: Try these scripts, see how long they take__. The running times reported in the orignal publication are shown in __TABLE__. __TODO: To simulate a single RRBS dataset would take HOW LONG__. The simulation scripts could be made more user-friendly by creating an R package, rather than supplying the software as a collection of scripts, and would benefit from some documentation.

### Simulating positions of methylation loci

All of the described methods, except \cite{Lacey:2013iy}, simulate methylation events based on a reference genome. \cite{Lacey:2013iy} propose a hidden Markov model for the intra-pair distances of CpGs in human RRBS data and simulate methylation loci based on this model. I do not think a model-based strategy is useful here, in fact I think it is counterproductive, and I prefer a sampling-based strategy, i.e., the use of methylation loci from a reference genome. While the set of methylation loci do vary across samples within a species due to genetic variation, it is a reasonable approximation to consider the positions of these loci as fixed, particularly when the main aim of the simulation model is to realistically simulate methylation levels and not the location of the methylation loci. Furthermore, if sequence variation is required then this can be achieved by sampling from this set of loci or by sampling from the set of methylation loci from a group of samples.

### Other model-based simulations

A separate class of model-based simulation methods are those that simulate the $\beta$-values directly, i.e., without simulating sequencing depth \cite[e.g.,]{Chen:2014jb, Chen:2013eh}. These models are designed for simulating microarray data and not sequencing data, since they do not include the variability caused by variation in sequencing depth.

## Methods based entirely on sampling real data

A simulation can be based entirely on sampling real data[^synthetic]. This type of simulated data is attractive because through careful sampling it can capture heterogeneity and correlations that may be too difficult to parameterise in a model. At the same time, if the sampling units are poorly chosen or the sampling strategy is incorrect then it may ignore these same features, or worse, introduce artefacts into the simulated data.

[^synthetic]: This may also be referred to as creating a synthetic dataset.
