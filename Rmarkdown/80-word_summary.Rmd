# The statistical analysis of data from high-throughput assays for studying DNA methylation

I develop a statistical framework for modelling and analysing DNA methylation data. In particular, I focus on the complex dependence structure of these data. I describe how this can be incorporated into statistical analyses of bisulfite-sequencing (BS-seq) experiments and develop software to simulate realistic BS-seq data by incorporating this dependence.

I also report results from my analysis of more than fifty BS-seq samples, both publicly available and those collected by collaborators, which have informed the methods developed in my thesis.
